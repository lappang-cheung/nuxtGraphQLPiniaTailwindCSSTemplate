## Purpose:
This is a boilerplate for anyone who sees this project and feel free to make a copy for your own project use. I am tired of always forgetting my setup for these projects, and this is my reminder for myself.

## Technologies:
1. Nuxt 3
2. TailwindCSS
3. Eslint
4. GraphQL Yoga
5. Pinia

## Installation:
1. npm install && npm run dev
2. yarn install && yarn dev
3. bun install && bun dev

## Notes:
1. I have set up the eslint for my style of coding. Please feel free to change on `eslint.config.mjs`.
2. GraphQL is being virtualized on the `h3` using the nitro engine that is located in the `server` folder structure. This is my solution for not running another node server and running in the Nuxt system.


HAPPY CODING!!!
